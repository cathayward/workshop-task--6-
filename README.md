# workshop-task--6-

### notes:

- I really struggled with coming up with a creative way to use this function but eventually settled on utilising ideas brought up in the workshop, and then taking the inputs and scrambling the output even further
- I didn’t want the original text to remain and instead only wanted the finished output to be shown on screen but managed to do this through some trial and error, by taking out the 0 value for the responses, only leaving the second output.
- i also used the font functions in order to add a unique font to the button instead of the default one, i also experimented with changing the colour of the text inside the button.
- this gave the sketch overall more pleasing to look at, and gave it some character and a set aesthetic
- i moved the input box over to the right hand side so that the text and the input weren’t in conflict with one another, due to the text being placed on the left hand side of the canvas
- i had some trouble deciding where i wanted each element to be but eventually decided on having the input box locked to the top right, and the text on the left hand side in the middle.
